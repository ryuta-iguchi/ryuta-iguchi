# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello! My name is Ryuta Iguchi. I was born in 2007 and am currently a high school student.

I'm currently studying to become a front-end engineer.

Right now, I'm leading a team to develop a game as a surprise graduation project at my high school. As the director, I handle everything from design and planning to coding and code review. Since all our members are new to development, I focus on supporting and mentoring the team to help everyone grow together.

After this project, I'm excited to start building web applications with TypeScript and to deepen my front-end skills even further!
